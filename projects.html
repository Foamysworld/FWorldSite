What is Foamy working on? Here is the page to find out. I'll add to the list as I get to a point where it's an actual script in production and not just an idea. This section will feature scripts that are both FMission related and not FMission related. Everything I plan to release will be listed here.

<h3>CODE DISCLAIMER:</h3>
<br>  
Do not change the base FMission files. You may use the scripts to make any mission type you want but I ask that the base files be left alone so the functionality can be maintained.
<br>
You may create new files FROM the original files to add on to your own personal Mission system but do NOT alter the originals within FMission.
<br>
Other than that, you may use the scripts as you see fit. Enjoy.
